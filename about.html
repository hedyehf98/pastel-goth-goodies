        <h1>About Pastel Goth Goodies</h1>
        <h2>About me! </h2>
        <p>My name is Hedyeh and I was born and raised in the United Kingdom. I have been alternative
            for over 10 years, with a passion for heavy music, spooky aesthetics and piercings!
        </p>
        <p>It may surprise you to know I am also a bit of a nerd, with a 2:1 integrated masters degree in 
            mathematics! Growing up, I was always a little eccentric and I struggled to interact with other
            humans. So to pass the time, I would study maths in the school library during break and ask
            for extra homework. I fell in love with the subject - so much so, I did a 4-year degree in it!
            During my final year of university, I decided to take up coding with the intention of being proficient
            enough such that one day, I would become a respected data scientist or web developer. This website
            has, in fact, been coded by me!

        <figcaption id="gradcap">At least my graduation gown was black...phew!</figcaption>
        <p>
            My mother told me, when I was little, I would excitedly jump up and down in front of the television
            whenever Marilyn Manson, Evanescence, Green Day or My Chemical Romance appeared on-screen. When I 
            was 14, I rediscovered my love for alternative music, started buying Kerrang! weekly, getting into
            new bands. I then experimented with my wardrobe, going through the dreaded scene and emo phases in 
            my latter teenaged years until I settled comfortably into the gothic subculture from my early 20s. 
        </p>
        <h2>How and when did Pastel Goth Goodies start?</h2>
        <p>During the lockdown, I noticed more than ever the alarming amount of clutter I had managed
            to accumulate over the years. So, I decided I would try making some extra cash, selling 
            second-hand clothing and accessories I no longer used. My items were selling fast and I became
            a dreaded regular at my local post office, sometimes having to lug suitcases of packages to post.
        <br>
            I noticed others on <a href="https://www.depop.com/xxdarkrosexx/" target="_blank">Depop</a>
             and <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/usr/creepycuteaccessories" target ="_blank">eBay</a> 
             selling handmade jewellery and accessories and thought 'Why don't I invest
            some of what I've made into making some too?' So, I spent a small amount of money on a few supplies to test
            the waters and...SUCCESS! My hairclips and earrings were so popular that after they'd sold, some 
            people messaged asking if there would be restocks, sad that they'd missed the opportunity. The more I made,
            the more I invested in making more unique and sophisticated jewellery - necklaces and bracelets. 
        <br>
            I have now sold over 500 second-hand clothing and accessories and 250 handmade jewellery items on Depop and eBay combined, with 100% 5* and positive
            feedback from buyers, many of whom return to order bundles. I love turning my creative ideas into a reality
            and making buyers happy! As a goth, I find the jewellery to be particularly extortionate. So, I price 
            my jewellery fairly to make it accessible to anyone and everyone.
